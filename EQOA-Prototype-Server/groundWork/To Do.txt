Things to do:

- Have server send out packets. This can be accomplished by passing in the serverShared and utilizing a queue to pass out messages.
- Add CRC to commOut function (This can be found in Devin's repo)
- There may be some incorrect... functions in places, so it doesn't add message/bundle #'s correctly (I remember a vague issue with it)
- Identify how to call/collect world options within rdpCommunicater.py
- Create and pass out ServerList.
- (Jimmy rig the F9's to keep packets alive for 2mins instead of 30 seconds)
- Prepare to process into character select. Framework should be there to process the first 2 packets from client.
- Consider adding a temporary *arg property so we can set IP/Port ourselves? This way we can spool 2 instances of the profile on 2 different ports?
- Create an internal master session, not too sure how this should look (Consider taking account information as variable inside this session)
- Send client connection packet
- Create Database stuff
- Character select generation (Utilizing the account information in master session would help the SQL queries in this stage)
